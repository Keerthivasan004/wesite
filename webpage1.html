        <h2>What is Dyslexia?</h2>
        <div class="para1">Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that affects a persons ability to read, write,
            and spell, despite having average or above-average intelligence. It primarily impacts 
            language processing skills, making it difficult to decode words, recognize phonetic patterns, 
            and connect written symbols with their sounds. Dyslexia varies in severity and can also affect memory, 
            concentration, and organization. It's a neurological condition, often diagnosed in childhood, that requires 
            targeted educational strategies and support to improve literacy skills. While dyslexia cannot be "cured,"
            individuals with dyslexia can learn strategies to manage the challenges it presents.
