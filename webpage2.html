At this stage, children are developing foundational skills in reading, writing, and spelling. Dyslexia may appear as difficulty in recognizing letters, connecting sounds to letters, blending sounds to form words, or reluctance to engage with reading and writing tasks. Early identification in this age group is crucial as it allows for timely intervention to help them build a strong foundation for literacy and academic success.</td>

Dyslexia at this stage may show as difficulty in organizing thoughts for essays or written assignments, keeping up with the reading demands of advanced materials, or expressing ideas effectively in writing despite strong verbal communication skills. Identifying dyslexia during this time can help develop strategies to manage academic challenges and prepare for future success.</td>

In professional or personal life, dyslexia can present as challenges in reading quickly, comprehending dense or complex materials, structuring written communication, or managing time effectively. Identifying dyslexia in adulthood provides an opportunity to implement tools and accommodations that enhance productivity and confidence in both career and daily tasks.</td>

            <li>Early Detection Helps: Identifying dyslexia in young children allows early intervention, which improves learning outcomes significantly.</li>
            <li>Different Challenges at Different Ages: Dyslexia affects people differently as they grow. Tailoring predictions to the age group ensures accurate results.</li>
            <li>Customized Assessments: Each age group requires specific tests or tools for effective prediction, as skills like reading, writing, and comprehension develop over time.
            </li>
            <li>Minimizing False Alarms: Choosing the right age group avoids misdiagnosing normal learning struggles as dyslexia.
            </li>
            <li>Effective Support Plans: Predictions based on the right age help design age-appropriate strategies to improve reading and writing skills.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximizing Brain Plasticity: Early identification, especially in young children, takes advantage of their brain’s ability to adapt and learn.
                </li>
            <li>Addressing Academic Challenges: Early predictions help prevent children from falling behind in school, as academic demands increase with age.
